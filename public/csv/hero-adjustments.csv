"Cici","04-11-2025","38","Cici's Delight stacks decay gradually when not dealing damage, granting her Movement Speed and Spell Vamp boost most of the time, making it difficult for enemies to counter. Therefore, we have increased the decay speed.

[Passive Adjustments] Nerf
Stack Removal: 1 stack reduced every 1s >> 1 stack reduced every 0.3s"
"Hilda","04-11-2025","38","Hilda's late-game minion clearing efficiency and durability are low, and she relies on Bushes to trigger her passive effect, leaving her with average performance in the Exp Lane.
So this time we redesigned Hilda's passive skill, changing the enhanced Basic Attack originally obtained from Skill 1 to entering a Bush, improving her Exp lane presence and minion clearing efficiency. Meanwhile, Skill 1 has been redesigned to grant a shield and speed boost, reducing her dependence on bushes.We've also optimized the control experience of Basic Attacks after Skill 2, improving passive stacking efficiency and combo smoothness.
To balance this, we've reduced how much the Passive Wilderness Mark reduces Physical & Magic Defense.

[Passive Adjustments] Adjust
Revamped :
When entering a Bush, Hilda enhances her next Basic Attack to deal 140(+70% Total Physical Attack)(+9*hero level) Pyhsical Damage and slow the target by 40% for 3s. Enemies behind behind the target take 70 (+50% Total Physical Attack)(7*hero level) Physical Damage, After using the enhanced Basic Attack. it enters a 6s cooldown.
Pursuit Speed of Enhanced Basic Attack : 10 >> 13
Each stack reduces the target's Physical Defense and Magic Defense by: 4% >> 3%

"Change","03-11-2025","38","Chang'e's tower pushing efficiency in the early-mid game is too high compared to other Mages, so we reduced her enhanced Basic Attack Damage. Damage and balanced it by reducing Skill 1's mid-late game cooldown.

Crescent Moon Damage : 20 (+35% Total Physical Atatck)(+35% Total Magic power) >> 20 (+35% Total Magic power)"
"Xavier","03-11-2025","38","Xavier relies on continuously hitting enemies with Skills 1 and 2 to enhance and enter the Transcendence state for stronger damage output. This doesn't align with our design expectations. Therefore, we've increased the width of all skills, changed Stage I to a permanent passive, and removed the original Stage II effect, allowing Xavier to enter to Transcendence state more quickly. To balance this chane, we've reduced the duration of Skill 2's immobilization.

[Passive Adjustments] Adjust
When Xavier hits an enemy hero with his skills, he gains 50% Movement Speed that decays over 1.2s. Each enemy hero hit by Xavier's skills generates one Energy charge. Upon reaching three charges, his next skill cast will enter the Transcendence state.

"Minotaur","02-11-2025","38","As a tank-roaming hero, Minotaur's ability to provide healing and buffs to his team far exceeds his own survivability as a tank. We want his combat ability to better match his character.
We've revamped the original Enraged Regen effect that enhanced Skill 2 as Minotaur's new passive to improve his durability in combat.
We've also added Slow Effects to the firsrt 2 hits of his Ultimate to improve the hit rate of the final hit's Airborne effect.
For balance, we have reduced Minotaur's ability to provide healing and buffs to allies, though he remains a unique tank with the ability to heal teammates.

[Passive Adjustments] Adjust

Minotaur gains motivation for 3s after using the skill. When Enraged, the HP regen effect is doubled.

"Layla","24-10-2025","38","As a late-game Marksman, Layla's farming speed was greatly affected by the decrease in Gold from Minions. Therefore, we've slightly increased her damage in the mid to late game.

"Bane","23-10-2025","38","We've noticed that Bane's fully charged Skill 2 venom deals excessive damage in Magic builds and is difficult to counter. To address this, we've reduced its Magic Power Bonus when full charged.

Extra Max HP Bonus : 30%-50% >> 50%"
"Bane","17-09-2025","38","Bane has been too reliant on Gold to scale in the current patch. We want him to have more impact in early team fights.so we've adjusted his damage curve,boosting his early and mid-game power. At the same time.we've increased the strength of the fully charged Skill 2.It's time to surprise enemies with a spit of venom!
The summoned sharks by Bane's Ultimate could easily be dodged by enemies through agile positioning or mobility skills. So we've reduced the Ultimate's foreswing while increasing the sharks' movement speed And optimized the Ultimate's airbone and slow effects. This should allow the enraged sharks to pose a greater threat to enemies.
To balance, we've reduced his late-game strength while removing the knockback effect from the Ultimate, preventing Bane from having extra time chasing knocked-back enemies.

"Angela","16-09-2025","38","We expected Angela to fight side-by-side with allies, but in actual matches, Angela spent most of her time away from allies. So we aim to enhance Angela's distinct characteristics. So we've significantly reduced her Ultimate's cooldown and optimized her Ultimate's auto-targeting logic to increase players' Ultimate usage frequency and support efficiency. We've made experience improvements to Angela's Passive and Skill 2, allowing players to better perceive battlefield conditions.
